# Miitti App

A map-based social app with the purpose of connecting people in the real, physical world over local activities in an effort to make your city feel like an inviting, open playground again. Do anything anywhere at any time together with friends you didn't know you had.

## Background

The app was in operation in Finland between January 2024 and June 2025 on both Android and iOS platforms, organically gathering close to a thousand users, but has since been taken down from both app stores. Upon terminating support, it was decided that the source code would be open-sourced and so, here it is licensed under an [MIT-license](LICENSE.md), exactly as it was on 1.6.2025 when it was officially discontinued.

## Getting Started

Instructions for running the project along with more information about code structure, principles, best practices and working with the repository in general can be found in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md). 

To try the mobile application, make sure to get your own API keys for all services, as all API keys used in this repository have been permanently deactived and many components of the app rely upon functionality enabled by, for example, Firebase. Ensure correct utilization of environment variables and `.gitignore`, especially if working on a public fork to avoid abuse of your secrets.

This project is no longer maintained and no issue or pull request will thus be considered. Fork it and use it as a template for your own projects instead.
